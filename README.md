# bricks

`bricks` calculates the detailed geometry of a brick wall bounded by an arbitrary polygon and its inner offset. The goal of this project is to make it easier to design structural masonry buildings.

This project is inspired by Clay Chapman's "Hope for Architecture" initiative. To learn more, see Chapman's presentation at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Em2vdCtNUc, and the Urban Guild at https://www.urbanguild.org.

# installation
